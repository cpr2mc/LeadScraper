# LeadScraper
Scraping websites for lead information

## Objective
I need to create an app that will pull the company names off of job websites like Indeed. 

### Amplifying Information
Time is not a constraint so I plan on using a simple webscraper and manually placing time pauses in between actions.

API's are being cut across large company websites so this is an attempt to create a flexible and long lasting solution that I can adapt for multiple uses, since I am doing lots of entry-level BDR type work at the moment.

The information I pull will be exported to an excel sheet for further manipulation. I will do this manually at first until I know what kind of parsing I find myself doing repeatedly, then I will try and automate using either excel tools or python tools.
